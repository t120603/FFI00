  -- voice record
    ** still some known issues that is working on resolving
{Known issues on voice record}
(a) problems on soothing music feature if user chooses a voice recording audio
    -- in this case, if user hasn't played the record on pixsee, app is not able to make
       device download this record
    -- the cry detection updates are not saved if user chooses a voice recorder to
       play nor the voice name is shown next to the "music" option at cry detection screen
(b) when the record fails to upload due to a Wi-Fi problem, when user retries the
    upload, it's always failed, so user can't add more voice recorders due the
    business rule where the "add" button should be disable while there is an audio 
    file whose upload has failed
(c) due these bugs, app still can't test the "delete a voice record that has been used
    by the soothing feature" scenario
